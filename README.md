# Survey Segmentation

In this tutorial you will learn the basics of verify segmentation, analyzing the data, and creating segments. When reviewing survey data, you will typically be handed likert questions (ex: answers with a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being bad and 5 being good). Using a few techniques, you can verify the quality of the survey and start grouping respondents into populations. The steps we will be following are listed below:
* Analyzing our data set for scale.
* Using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to verify that the survey is sound and grouping data.
* Checking for correlated questions.
* Setting up the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to create the final segments.

## Getting Started

This tutorial is written as a Python Jupyter notebook. All instructions and code is self-contained within the notebook file itself. That file can be found in the top directory of the repository: Survey Segmentation.ipynb.

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, the easiest method to get all required software is to install Anaconda. It will come with a Python environment, Jupyter Notebook, and an IDE (Spyder) to run your Python code.

## Deployment

When running the code on your own system, make sure to point the CSV file to the correct directory.
